## Hello!! I'm Julian,

### About Me
I am mainly a programmer with a focus on video game development, but I am also very interested in learning more about Game Design, Story Telling, and 3D Technical Art.<br/>
Currently, I am studying Animation & Game at [hda](https://h-da.de/).

## Projects
### Collaborative Projects
- [Deeper](https://github.com/1Bazzelle/Deeper): An educational, underwater exploration game, which encourages the player to learn about real world fish species by taking pictures of them.
- [Jam em Up](https://github.com/JoshGamesHda/RR_1.git): A point defense game where attack towers gain buffs when placed adjacent to support buildings.
- [Pirate Game](https://github.com/1Bazzelle/Pirate-Game/tree/main): A homework project, in which I familiarized myself with the technical aspects of several Unity Features, like Unity Netcode, ScriptableObjects, or ObjectPools.

### Personal Projects
- [Combo System](https://github.com/1Bazzelle/ComboSystemPrototype): In this project, I wanted to create a system that allowed to modularly chain fully customizable attacks together. Here, I also learned about how Custom Editors in Unity work. It was sadly never completed, but the backend structure for comboing exists.
- [Twark](https://github.com/1Bazzelle/Twark-II): A small project, for which the goal was simply to implement spring physics for the player character.
- [Jet Game](https://github.com/1Bazzelle/Jet-Game/tree/main): My first Unity Project. It was my introduction to Unity's Transform system and Quaternions. The focus here was to smoothly interpolate the Third Person Camera to follow the jet plane.
