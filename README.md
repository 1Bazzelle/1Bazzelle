## Hi, I'm Julian

### About Me
I'm a  programmer specializing in video game development.  I love creating performant systems or interesting game mechanics to allow for a project to really come to life.
Currently, I am studying Animation & Game at [hda](https://h-da.de/)

### Collaborative Projects
- [Deeper](link): An educational, underwater exploration game, which encourages the player to learn about real world fish species by taking pictures of them.
- [Jam em Up](link): A point defense game, in which attack towers can be boosted, by being placed orthogonally adjacent to a support building
- [Pirate Game](link): A homework project, which had the purpose of making me familiarize myself with the technical aspects of several Unity Features and Asset Packages.

### Personal Projects
- [Combo System](link): In this project, I wanted to create a system that allowed to modularly chain fully customizable attacks together however one likes. Here, I also learned about how Custom Editors in Unity work.
- [Twark](link): Don't mind the unbelievably creative name. In this small project, my goal was to implement spring physics.
- [Jet Game](link): My first Unity Project. Here, I tried around with rotations and smooth interpolation of camera movement.
