## üëæ Projects
### Collaborative Projects
- [Deeper](https://github.com/1Bazzelle/Deeper): An educational, underwater exploration game, which encourages the player to learn about real world fish species by taking pictures of them.
- [Jam em Up](https://github.com/JoshGamesHda/RR_1.git): A point defense game where attack towers gain buffs when placed adjacent to support buildings.
- [Pirate Game](https://github.com/1Bazzelle/Pirate-Game/tree/main): A homework project, in which I familiarized myself with the technical aspects of several Unity Features, like Unity Netcode, ScriptableObjects, or ObjectPools.

### Personal Projects
- [Combo System](https://github.com/1Bazzelle/ComboSystemPrototype): In this project, I wanted to create a system that allowed to modularly chain fully customizable attacks together. Here, I also learned about how Custom Editors in Unity work.
- [Twark](https://github.com/1Bazzelle/Twark-II): A small project, for which the goal was to implement spring physics.
- [Jet Game](https://github.com/1Bazzelle/Jet-Game/tree/main): My first Unity Project. It was my introduction to Unity's Transform system and Quaternions. The focus here was to smoothly interpolate the Third Person Camera behind the jet.
